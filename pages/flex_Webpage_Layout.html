                <article><h2>Are Mumbai Indians the most dominant team in IPL history?</h2>
                    <p>Mumbai Indians may have overtaken Chennai Super Kings on the IPL trophy count last season itself, 
                        but given that CSK were barred from playing for two years, it is only this year that the baton of 
                        the most dominant team in IPL has truly passed on to Rohit Sharma's men. Mumbai Indians' third trophy 
                        in four years has coincided with the ageing team of CSK failing for the first time in the tournament's 
                        history to finish in the top four. But the 2020 campaign and the dominance in the last four years, begs 
                        one question - has there been a more dominant team in IPL's history?</p><br>
                    <p>To understand that, we first take a look at how far ahead MI were in comparison to the second-best 
                        team in the competition and the tournament averages. While Sunrisers Hyderabad ended marginally better 
                        in some bowing parameters than MI in 2020, the champions were significantly ahead of the pack in terms 
                        of scoring runs. Mumbai's pace battery picked 28 wickets in Powerplay at an average of 19.82 and a wicket 
                        every 16.9 balls and they were the only team to concede under nine in the death overs.</p>
